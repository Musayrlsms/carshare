# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization

# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.

# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t "hello"
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t("hello") %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# The following keys must be escaped otherwise they will not be retrieved by
# the default I18n backend:

# Instead, surround them with single quotes.

    what_is_oi_jo_content: 'Oi-jo is Europe first car rental web service enabling car Owners to
								provide car rental services to Renters who plan to stay in Croatia or,
								respectively, in the European Union. Users of our services can, with full
								confidence, rent cars from private car Owners and car dealers. We do
								this by creating a “trusted marketplace” where car Owners post
								information about their vehicles FREE OF CHARGE on our Website,
								while Renters find available cars and book them through our web
								service, after being subjected to a simple verification process.
								We specialise in car rental periods between 7 and 365 days, and we
								charge about 40% less than traditional car rental agencies. For car
								Owners we offer the possibility to earn money by renting out their cars
								that they are not using or that are not needed throughout a specific
								period.'

The Agreement needs to be printed out and, at the meeting with the Renter, it would be desirable that both parties read and analyse it. In the case of any lack of clarity, it would be best to get in touch with Oi-jo. Such Agreement is a legally binding agreement between the service provider and the service recipient. It must be signed by the Renter prior to vehicle handover. The vehicle Owner must then e-mail a copy of the Agreement directly to Oi-jo Headquarters (if a subsidiary is registered in a certain country, everything is signed on the spot, at the presence of a Oi-jo representative).'
    
    question_9: 'Who will complete the Inspection Report, and when?'

The same applies at vehicle drop-off. The Vehicle Inspection Report will be available for download via the Oi-jo Website or will be e-mailed to both parties. The car Owner will photograph and send the signed copies of the Report to Oi-jo headquarters, either per e-mail or by means of a dedicated application, in order to make the data from the Inspection report available to Oi-jo.'

    question_22_content: 'Yes. The car Owner must be available 24/7, including weekends, during the rental period. A contact number will be stated in the Rental Agreement, a copy of which will be handed over to the Renter along with the car keys. Should the car Owner be unavailable, the roadside assistance shall be called that is available at all hours and whose number is indicated in the copy of the Rental Agreement kept by the Renter.'

    question_23: 'Is an option provided to use roadside assistance services during rental?'
    question_23_content: 'Yes. The roadside assistance service is available (and free of charge) only if the car Owner has this option registered for car rental in his insurance policy. If this option is not a part of the Owner’s vehicle insurance, any road assistance provider will charge for its services. Each country provides a 24/7 road assistance service accessible via the number stated in your Vehicle Rental Agreement.

    question_27: 'How do I list my vehicle on the Oi-jo Website?'
    question_27_content: 'Listing your vehicle is easy and only takes 5 minutes. Click Log in at the top of any page and complete the user registration form. If you are a Facebook, Google+ or Twitter user, the log in procedure is even quicker (if you have correct data such as first and last name, date of birth etc.). If you are already registered, just log in with your user name and password and go to My Cars. Click Add Car and complete the card details form. You can always update your contact details, data about your listed vehicle and change the vehicle availability status at any point of time.'

    question_30_content: 'The Renter must get in touch with the car Owner in order to inform him about the delay in the return of the vehicle. The Owner is entitled to charge the Renter for additional hours if the vehicle is returned after a delay of more than 5 hours (depending on the cause of delay; if the delay is justified, even more; for instance: weather conditions, roadworks etc.) after the agreed return time. If the vehicle is not returned and the Renter cannot be reached by the Owner, the vehicle may be reported to the police as stolen. Please absolutely get in touch with the Renter of your car and do not miss to complete the section with the contact numbers at handover of your car (if possible, contacts of several persons if they are present at vehicle handover - family, friend).'
    
    question_31: 'What happens if the Renter doesen’t pay?'
    question_31_content: 'Oi-jo freezes a certain amount on the Renter’s credit card in order to protect Owners against such unwanted unpaid charges. If the Renter refuses to pay at the conclusion of the rental period, this will have an impact on his/her creditworthiness, and high amounts plus interest will be charged to his/her credit card.'
    
    question_32: 'What happens if the car is stolen?'
    question_32_content: 'If the car is deemed stolen, please contact the Owner and the police immediately. In the event that the vehicle is not returned in the agreed time and the Renter has not got in touch with you for more than 5 hours after the agreed-on time frame, the car should be reported as stolen. All other issues will be resolved by insurance and the police. Moc-Moc will do everything it can to pay a part of the costs to the Owner until the vehicle is found.'

    question_33: 'What will happen if the Renter fails to observe the terms and conditions of the Rental Agreement?'
    question_33_content: 'If the Renter fails to observe or violates the terms and conditions of booking, please contact the Renter and arrange return of the vehicle. As Owner, you will receive payment from the part of the amount frozen on the Renter’s credit card, so that no damage of any kind will be incurred to you. '
    
    question_34: 'What if the rental vehicle is involved in a road traffic accident?'
    question_34_content: 'If a traffic accident occurs in which the rental vehicle is involved, the Renter will first get in touch with you as the Owner, and then you will instruct the Renter with regard to next steps and contacts (police etc.). Vehicle-related costs will be covered by insurance. If the Renter was under the influence of alcohol or narcotics, he will be obligated to pay for the damage on the car himself (we have already frozen a certain amount for the possible event of damage, therefore the Renter will not be able to avoid payment for damage). In his/her Agreement, the Renter will find all emergency numbers, including your number.'
  
    question_35: 'What if the car stops working?'
    question_35_content: 'If the car stops working for no apparent reason, the Renter will contact either the Owner or the roadside assistance service. After that, the causes of the car’s breakdown will be identified. If the breakdown was caused by any worn part of the car that should have undergone regular servicing, in such case the Owner will have to bear the costs incurred, by subtracting the costs incurred from the vehicle rental income (it is understood that an identical breakdown would happen to Owner at another point of time).'
